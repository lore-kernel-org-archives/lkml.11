For better or for worse, I've always assumed that the kernel had its
reasons -- legitimate reasons, even -- for preferring `unsigned long` to
a userspace type like `uintptr_t`, so I've always tried to code that
way.

If that's a "dinosaur approach" that "has to stop", it'd certainly be
news to me (and I'm guessing others on the list too). I've never really
seen anybody question the kernel's `unsigned long` usage before.

So hopefully some outcome of this discussion will make it clear, and
then either this patch will go in, or I'll get to work on carefully
adjusting my code that uses `unsigned long` at the moment.

Jason
