Hi,

 This series was dropped from x86/irq due to a bug in a follow-up patch,
so resending verbatim after re-verification.

 Nikolai has observed the trigger mode not being fixed up once it has been 
incorrectly set by the BIOS for PCI devices, causing all kinds of usual 
issues.  As it turns out we don't have a PIRQ router defined for the 
SiS85C497 southbridge, which Nikolai's system uses, and which is different 
from the SiS85C503 southbridge we have support for.

 As we use the generic `sis' infix (capitalised or not) for the SiS85C503 
southbridge I have prepared this small patch series to first make the 
existing SiS program entities use a more specific `sis503' infix, and then
provide a suitable PIRQ router for the SiS85C497 device.

 See individual change descriptions for further details.

 Please apply.

  Maciej
