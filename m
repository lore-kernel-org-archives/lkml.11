The problem with ptrace_stop and do_signal_stop that requires dropping
siglock and grabbing tasklist_lock is that do_notify_parent_cldstop
needs tasklist_lock to keep parent and real_parent stable.

With just some very modest code changes it looks like we can use
a processes own siglock to keep parent and real_parent stable.  The
siglock is already acquired in all of those places it is just not held
over the changing parent and real_parent.

Then make a rule that a child's siglock must be grabbed before a parents
siglock and do_notify_parent_cldstop can be always be called under the
childs siglock.

This means ptrace_stop can be significantly simplified, and the
notifications can be moved far enough up that set_special_state
can be called after do_notify_parent_cldstop.  With the result
that there is simply no PREEMPT_RT issue to worry about and
wait_task_inactive can be used as is.

I remember Oleg suggesting a change something like this a long
time ago.


I need to handle the case where the parent and the child share
the same sighand but that is just remembering to handle it in
do_notify_parent_cldstop, as the handling is simply not taking
the lock twice.

I am going to play with that and see if I there are any gotcha's
I missed when looking through the code.
