Hmm.  Maybe.

Prior to JOBCTL_DELAY_WAKEKILL once __state was set to __TASK_TRACED
we were guaranteed that schedule() would stop if a SIGKILL was
received after that point.  As well as being immune from wake-ups
from SIGKILL.

I guess we are immune from wake-ups with JOBCTL_DELAY_WAKEKILL as I have
implemented it.

The practical concern then seems to be that we are not guaranteed
wait_task_inactive will succeed.  Which means that it must continue
to include the TASK_TRACED bit.

Previously we were actually guaranteed in ptrace_check_attach that after
ptrace_freeze_traced would succeed as any pending fatal signal would
cause ptrace_freeze_traced to fail.  Any incoming fatal signal would not
stop schedule from sleeping.  The ptraced task would continue to be
ptraced, as all other ptrace operations are blocked by virtue of ptrace
being single threaded.

I think in my tired mind yesterday I thought it would messing things
up after schedule decided to sleep.  Still I would like to be able to
let wait_task_inactive not care about the state of the process it is
going to sleep for.
