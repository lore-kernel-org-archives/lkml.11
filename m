Oh darn ... sorry, I was quite busy and didn't really pay attention. I will
answer the earlier mail and think about it.

Though, maybe you can help me with that what keeps me so busy. Would it be okay
to use a kthread in a hwmon driver to do sampling (500ms - 10s) in conjunction
with HWMON_C_UPDATE_INTERVAL, or is this a strict no-no? I know it is actually
used to set a sample/update rate in a sensor (-register), but this USB-HID
approach is a pure polling thing. It seems to work quite and enables the driver
to collect data quite early in the boot process.

greetings
