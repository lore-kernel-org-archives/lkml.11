Awesome, thank you Jakub!

Greg, I now created an immutable branch for moving wfx from
drivers/staging to drivers/net/wireless/silabs:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/wireless/wireless-next.git wfx-move-out-of-staging

The baseline for this branch is v5.18-rc1. If you think the branch is
ok, please pull it to staging-next and let me know. I can then pull the
branch to wireless-next and the transition should be complete. And do
let me know if there are any problems.
