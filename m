Hmm.  If we have the following process tree.

    A
     \
      B
       \
        C

Process A, B, and C are all in the same process group.
Process A and B are setup to receive SIGCHILD when
their process stops.

Process C traces process A.

When a sigstop is delivered to the group we can have:

Process B takes siglock(B) siglock(A) to notify the real_parent
Process C takes siglock(C) siglock(B) to notify the real_parent
Process A takes siglock(A) siglock(C) to notify the tracer

If they all take their local lock at the same time there is
a deadlock.

I don't think the restriction that you can never ptrace anyone
up the process tree is going to fly.  So it looks like I am back to the
drawing board for this one.

Eric
