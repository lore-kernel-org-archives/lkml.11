One more thing.  I'm trying to add support for STATX_DIOALIGN on block devices.
Unfortunately I don't think it is going to work, at all, since the inode is for
the device node and not the block device itself.  This is true even after the
file is opened (I previously thought that at least that case would work).

Were you expecting that this would work on block devices?  It seems they will
need a different API -- a new BLK* ioctl, or files in /sys/block/$dev/queue.
