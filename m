Actually that is a file in securityfs.  Which is related but slightly
different.  For sysfs this would be immediately unacceptable as it
breaks the one value per file rule.  I don't know what the rules
are for securityfs but I do know files that contain many many lines
and get very large tend to be problematic in both their kernel
implementation and in userspace parsing speed.

So I am looking for what the advantage of this file that justifies the
cost of maintaining it.

I don't understand the problem you are trying to solve.  If the software
needs to updated what benefit is there for all of the information to be
available at runtime?

The mapping between capabilities and numbers should never change it is
ABI.  I seem to remember a version number in the file capability so that
if the mappings do change that number can be changed in a way that
existing software is not confused.

What is the advantage in printing all of the mappings?
