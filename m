The name of the field is confusing for anyone who isn't intimate with
the implementation details.  The function getppid returns
tsk->real_parent->tgid.

If kdb wants information of what the tracer is that is fine, but I
recommend putting that information in another field.

Given that the original description says give the information that ps
gives my sense is that kdb is currently wrong.  Especially as it does
not give you the actual parentage anywhere.

I can certainly be convinced, but I do want some clarity.  It looks very
attractive to rename task->parent to task->ptracer and leave the field
NULL when there is no tracer.

Eric
