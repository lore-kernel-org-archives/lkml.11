TBH I think it would be better "fixed" with a kmemleak_ignore() and a 
big comment, rather than adding API cruft for something that isn't a 
real problem. I'm quite sure that no real-world user is unbinding 
remoteproc drivers frequently enough that leaking a 48-byte allocation 
each time has any practical significance.

Thanks,
Robin.
