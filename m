Honestly, I don't hate this :)

It seems conceptually accurate, as far as I understand, and in 
functional terms I'm starting to think it might even be the most correct 
approach anyway. In the physical world we might be surprised to find the 
PCI side of a host bridge behind anything other than some platform/ACPI 
device representing the other side of a physical host bridge or root 
complex, but who's to say that a paravirtual world can't present a more 
abstract topology? Either way, a one-line way of tying in to the 
standard flow is hard to turn down.
