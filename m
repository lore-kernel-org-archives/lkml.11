You may mean the external MSI interrupt controller case, but here the
focus is the integrated MSI Receiver in the IP. Normally, after
suspending to ram, the dwc IP would lost power, so the integrated MSI
Receiver also lost power.

For the integrated MSI Receiver case, since the entire IP power is lost,
so the PCIE_MSI_INTR0_MASK|ENABLE setting is lost, we need to resume the
mask to the one before suspending. For PCIE_MSI_INTR0_ENABLE register(s),
since it's always 0xffffffff, so current code is fine.

Even with suspend/resume hooks, we still need to fix the
PCIE_MSI_INTR0_MASK wrong setting with always ~0. After the fix, msi works
so we don't need suspend/resume hooks any more.

Thanks
