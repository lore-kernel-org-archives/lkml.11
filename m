Sorry for coming back to this again late, but this makes me believe that 
the real problem for the freeze in setserial is that uart_port_shutdown() 
is calling synchronize_irq() after free_irq(), which is illegal in my 
opinion.

It can be done only before the interrupt thread is stopped, and free_irq() 
itself is already taking care about synchronizing, no matter if its done by 
__synchronize_hardirq() or by synchronize_irq(), like it was before commit 
519cc8652b3a.
If it is called after free_irq(), the context is already lost.

I am not sure about all the other drivers, but at least serial_core should 
be fixed if you agree.

Thanks,
    Thomas
