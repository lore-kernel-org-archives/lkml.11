Well not after the change above, but in a later patch yes.

Patch 1/7 really gets us back to the previous status quo, where
I introduced the breakage.

Agreed.  I proposed a patch to do just that a little while ago.

I looked earlier and I missed this one.  I am going to look again today,
along with applying the obvious fix to task_tick_numa.

I don't think there are many but when the code has evolved into a shape
that is not easy to understand things occasionally slip through when the
abstractions are made clear to understand.  The reason to rework the
code and make it clear is that once the code has evolved to a point of
many subtle issues making any change is brittle.
