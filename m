After speaking to Benjamin, it was clear that ABS_MISC wasn't the right
absolute axis to use.

I think that adding a new ABS_* axes in include/uapi/linux/input-event-
codes.h would be the best, for example ABS_PROFILE as 0x21.

Dmitry, what do you think?

The idea here is to encode a hardware controlled switch that has 4
possible values. Its state will be sent with every input event in order
for user-space to (maybe) apply a specific profile to the events.

This would also be used by the XBox Elite 2 controller driver.

Cheers
