Is that true as well for the user process that has this mapped? Will the
user process virtual memory that maps to this ever page it out? I
believe that was the concern. My understanding is by reserving in
kernel, even though it won't page out on that side, marks the user side
entry to not let it page out.

The other thing is that this patch applied to 5.10.X on ARM64 does not
appear to hit this. Is it some weird interaction with something else or
was 5.10.X just getting lucky?

Thanks,
