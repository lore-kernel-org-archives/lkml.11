Sorry for the super late review, I was swamped. OK so the only issue
I can think of is that rmmod *used* to support the kernel wait support
with $(rmmod --wait) so wouldn't this be odd?

It is why I had gone with:

 -p | --remove-patiently   patiently removes the module
 -t | --timeout            timeout in ms to remove the module

You would know better though.

Also just curious, is it really terrible to just support waiting
forever?
