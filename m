Hi Alex,

Missed this remark before:

No. Did you read the 0/2 cover letter? I'll quote it for you here:

What about that was unclear to you?

Anyway, it's a different thing that will have to be designed and
considered carefully, and that design doesn't have a whole lot to do
with this little driver here, except insofar as it could build on top of
it in one way or another. Yes, it's an important thing to do. No, I'm
not going to do it in this patch here. If you want to have a discussion
about that, start a different thread.

Thanks,
Jason
