The features member is exposed to userspace which will be the main
consumer in order to know what to expect from a particular RTC.

ALARM_RES_2S could also be used to forbid setting the alarm for two
consecutive seconds but this is not yet implemented as you observed.
This is not the most pressing issue but currently it is allowed and you
will not get any interrupt from the RTC for the second alarm so this is
silently ignored.
Note that these two are probably not the only ones that are affected,
those are the ones I did test.
