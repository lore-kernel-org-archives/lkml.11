I implemented the poll() case here in 15 lines of code and found it
remarkably simple to do:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220302143331.654426-1-Jason@zx2c4.com/

This is just a PoC/RFC for the sake of having something tangible to look
at for this thread. It is notable to me, though, that implementing this
was so minimal.
