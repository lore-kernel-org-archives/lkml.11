Thank you.

I will verify this works before I add my updated version to
my signal-for-v5.18 branch.

Have you by any chance tried a newer version of linux-next without
commit fbc11520b58a ("signal: Make SIGKILL during coredumps an explicit
special case") in it?

If not I will double check that my pulling the commit out does not break
in the case you have documented.

Eric
