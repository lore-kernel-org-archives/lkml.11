Does the same issue exist for f2fs and ubifs?  We could solve the
specific bug much more simply by having ext4_empty_dir() return FALSE
if we aren't able to read the directory block.  Yes, it means that we
don't return as specific an error code in the case of an I/O error ---
although I believe we do syslog a warning --- but it makes for a much
simpler patch that doesn't requiring getting acked-by's from the
fscrypt, f2fs and ubifs folks.
