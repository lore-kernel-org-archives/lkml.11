Hi Shuah,

a small series collecting a few trivial fixes that I have already sent
previously (~Dec2021) as distinct patches.

They are mostly trivial patches addressing failures that seemed more
sensible to be marked as skips instead. (at least to me ...).
Original developers are in Cc. (but not heard back from anyone :D)

Thanks,
Cristian
