We have a mechanism for dynamically reducing the number of page faults
already; it's just buried in the page cache code.  You have vma->vm_file,
which contains a file_ra_state.  You can use this to track where
recent faults have been and grow the size of the region you fault in
per page fault.  You don't have to (indeed probably don't want to) use
the same algorithm as the page cache, but the _principle_ is the same --
were recent speculative faults actually used; should we grow the number
of pages actually faulted in, or is this a random sparse workload where
we want to allocate individual pages.

Don't rely on the user to ask.  They don't know.
