Sure, will split this patch into two i.e kernel and user space changes. I have
an updated series which has some more kernel and user space API changes. But I
am wondering if there should be just a single patch updating user space API for
all the preceding kernel changes, or there should be one user space API patch
for each corresponding kernel change ?

Will run the diff after the series has been applied to demonstrate all the API
changes and update that in the cover letter.
