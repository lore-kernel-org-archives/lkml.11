I really think we need to do something like that.  Probably just set a
flag in commit_creds and test later.

I was working on fixes that looked cleaner and I just recently realized
that the test in fork is almost as bad.  The function has_capability can
be used but the same kind of problems exist.

I thought I was very quickly going to have patches to post but I need
to redo everything now that I have noticed the issue in fork, so it will
be a day or so.
