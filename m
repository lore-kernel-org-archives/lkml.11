As Manivannan clarified in another email, these clocks are actually consumed by
the cpufreq-hw node, so existing code was fine.

Right, and they (Qcom) have skipped adding that in DT currently. I have
suggested to him to add it there, which will solve the issue as well.

Yes, we need to mention only the clocks which are consumed directly by the CPU,
maybe just one of them which comes out of cpufreq-hw node.

Not always I think. It provides register access for programming or voting for
the clock, etc. Yes, the code won't do clk_set_rate() but the DT should still
mention the clock in the CPU node if it mentions an OPP table with frequencies
in it.
