Then there's something odd in your use case. Old kernels are aimed at
those who need to have systems on which nothing changes. It's particularly
strange to be stuck in the past for the kernel but to continually upgrade
userland. Most often it's the opposite that's seen.

Regardless, if you need an older compiler, just use these ones:

   https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/tools/crosstool/

They go back to 4.9.4 for x86, you'll surely find the right one for your
usage. I've long used 4.7.4 for kernels up to 4.9 and 6.5 for 4.19 and
above, so something within that area will surely match your needs.

No, using a prebuilt toolchain like those above is quite trivial and
it will avoid messing up with your local packages. That's the best
solution I can recommend.
