Indeed.  For this to work we'd need to call the filter driver
later.  Which is brings up another question:  Is there a real
need to attach the filter driver to the bdev and thus potentially
partition?  The rest of the block layer operates on the whole disk
after the intial partition remapping, and besides allowing the
filter driver to be called under q_usage_counter, this would
also clean up some concepts.  It would probably also allow to
remove the repeat return value over just using submit_bio_noacct
similar to how normal stacking drivers reinject bios.
