Not sure what you mean, but I think no.

Is that two colors in one package?

Anyways, the request for a multicolor gpio led driver hit the list a
few times in the past, but AFAIK no one stepped forward with actual
patches.  If you have something, just throw it on the list, if it's
not in perfect shape, maybe as RFC.  I think that would be highly
appreciated by other users. :-)
