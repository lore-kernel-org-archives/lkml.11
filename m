The power values in the EM which has abstract scale, would make sense to 
EAS, but not for IPA or DTPM. Those platforms which want to enable EAS,
but don't need IPA, would register such '<a_good_name_here>' EM.

That is doable. I can add that flag, so we can call it 'artificial' EM
(when this new flag is set).

Let me craft the RFC patch with this new flag proposal then.
Do you agree? Can I also add you as 'Suggested-by'?

Thank you for coming back to me with the comments.
