I think we are mostly in agreement here.

There are kernel threads started by modules that do:
	complete(...);
        return 0;

That should be at a minimum calling complete_and_exit.  Possibly should
be restructured to use kthread_stop().

Some of those users of the now removed thread_exit() in staging are
among the offenders.

However thread_exit() was implemented as:
	#define thread_exit() complete_and_exit(NULL, 0)

Which does nothing with a completion, it was just a really funny way to
spell "do_exit(0)".

While I agree digging through all of the kernel threads and finding the
ones that should be calling complete_and_exit is a fine idea.  It is
a concern independent of these patches.
