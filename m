I don't have an answer, sorry.

I personally don't actually have a lot of interest in the crypto accelerator
support in the crypto API, since in the domain I work in (storage encryption)
it's much more common for inline encryption hardware to be used instead, and
that has its own support in the Linux block layer, separate from the crypto API.

If there are fundamental issues with how crypto accelerators are supported in
the crypto API, then I think that the people who actually care about such
hardware need to get together to create a plan for correctly supporting it.
Doing separate crypto operations on contiguous buffers is absolutely something
that users can expect to work, so if that in fact cannot work, then I expect
that this limitation will need to be very explicitly documented and checked in
the crypto API, and users will need to explicitly opt-in to being able to use
crypto accelerators rather than having them (sort of) be used by default.
