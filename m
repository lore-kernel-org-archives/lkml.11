You know it might be.  Especially given that the existing code is
already dropping siglock and grabbing tasklist_lock.

It would take a potentially triple lock function to lock
the task it's real_parent and it's tracer (aka parent).

That makes this possible to consider is that notifying the ``parents''
is a fundamental part of the operation so we know we are going to
need the lock so we can move it up.

Throw in a pinch of lock_task_sighand and the triple lock function
gets quite interesting.

It is certainly worth trying, and I will.
