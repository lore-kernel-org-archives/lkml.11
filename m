Hi Daniel,

I just want to let you know that in current Android kernels we cannot
even compile the kernel with CONFIG_DEBUG_FS. I have this pain with
Energy Model there... Some vendors might see useful info via this
sysfs interface in bring-up of the SoC.

I don't know if there are user-space tools tracking this
information via sysfs. We probably should check that.

I agree that these statistics look more like debug info, rather than
something useful for control.

Furthermore, we have trace events for the cooling state changes, which
should be good enough for bring-up and experiments.

I don't have strong preferences here. I tend to agree to remove this
interface if there are no user-space tools using it.

Regards,
Lukasz
