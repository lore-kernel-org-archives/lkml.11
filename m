vmalloc in atomic context?

Not only does dev_coredumpm set a device name dev_coredumpm creates an
entire device to hold the device dump.

My sense is that either dev_coredumpm needs to be rebuilt on a
completely different principle that does not need a device to hold the
coredump (so that it can be called from interrupt context) or that
dev_coredumpm should never be called in an context that can not sleep.


Looking at fw_dump_timer_fn the only purpose of the timer is to trigger
a device dump after a certain amount of time.  So I suspect all that is
needed to fix this issue is to change the type of devdump_timer to
struct delayed_work and use scheduled_delayed_work instead of mod_timer.

p.s.  I looked at this because there was coredump in the infrastructure
name, and I do some of the work to keep coredumps working.  Device dump
seems like a much better term, and I wished the designer of the api had
used that instead.
