Steven had feedback on patchset 1 here:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220726180115.69320865@gandalf.local.home/

I've updated patchset 1 and 3 to address this feedback.

Updated patchsets:
1. https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220728233309.1896-1-beaub@linux.microsoft.com/
3. https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220728235241.2249-1-beaub@linux.microsoft.com/

Thanks,
-Beau
