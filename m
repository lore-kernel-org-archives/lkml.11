The advantage is that you get machine code that *works*.  There are
quite a few mnemonics that translate to different instructions with
different machine options!  We like to get the intended instructions
instead of something that depends on what assembler options the user
has passed behind our backs.

That never was a goal of this at all.

-many was very problematical for GCC itself.  We no longer use it.
