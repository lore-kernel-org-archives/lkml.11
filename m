Wonderful, thank you!

This quite fittingly marks the end of an era for me, so I would like to
thank everyone involved, more or less in order of appearance:

Oliver Hartkopp    for slcan (the inspiration) and related feedback.
Oliver Neukum      for the first reviews, before this went public.
Marc Kleine-Budde  for upstream guidance.
Greg Kroah-Hartman for TTY and style support.
Vincent Mailhol    for intensive reviews up until the end.

...and of course thanks to the numerous people I've been in touch with
via GitHub and otherwise. Bug reports, testing, or simply thanks and
encouragement - they have all helped.


Some stats for those interested: It has been a solid 8 years since the
idea for this driver was born in 2014, with occasional on and off work
on it since. The oldest code is from 2015, running in userspace and
injecting packets via vcan. It became a kernel module in 2016, with
link settings via "ip link". The first public version was released in
2018. It then gained in popularity, making upstreaming... inevitable ;)


Thank you all!


Max
