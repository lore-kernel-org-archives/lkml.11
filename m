My apologies.  When I first looked at this I thought this change was
non-sense.  However I had missed the special logic that happens with
RLIMIT_NPROC to carefully allow the root user to bypass the NPROC
limits.

So yes this does look like something that needs to be addressed as well.

Thank you for reporting all of these issues.
