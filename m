Just wanted to make a note about the "old" systems.

While RHEL 7 might be regarded as "old" in general, it may not be so
in the world of Enterprise Linux. A graph of EPEL mirror stats [1],
while it is from about a year ago, shows EL 7 (RHEL 7 and its
rebuilds) has a huge user base and was still growing quite fast.

By the way, my main workstation runs RHEL 7. ;-)
