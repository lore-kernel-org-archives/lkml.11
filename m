Yes. Signals like SIGSEGV are what force_sig_info_to_task is used for.

Signals where a userspace instruction causes a fault and the signal
is delivered immediately (synchronously) with that fault.

Or adding some kind of feature to the kernel where you can report that
some signal is unblockable.

So the idea is to use normal signal delivery but to set a flag
to indicate that the signal was blocked at the time it was sent?

It should be possible to add another field that takes a non-zero
value.  On older kernels it should always have a value of zero so it
should be safe.

It might also be possible to simply ignore the signal if it is blocked.

In either case it will probably take a little bit of care to get the
races out.
