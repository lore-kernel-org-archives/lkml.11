Back then you mentioned that apache suexec was broken.  Do you have
any more details?

I would like to make certain the apache suexec issue is fixed but
without a few details I can't do that.  I tried looking but I can't
find an public report about apache suexec being broken.

My goal is to come up with a very careful and conservative set of
patches that fix all of the known issues with RLIMIT_NPROC.
