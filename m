Adding the containers list to the discussion so more interested people
have a chance of seeing this.

At a high level I do agree that we need to send a message to a userspace
process and that message should contain enough information to start the
user mode helper.

Then a daemon or possibly the container init can receive the message
and dispatch the user mode helper.

Fundamentally that design solves all of the container issues, and I
think solves a few of the user mode helper issues as well.

The challenge with this design is that it requires someone standing up a
daemon to receive the messages and call a user mode helper to retain
compatibility with current systems.



I would prefer to see a file descriptor rather than a signal used to
deliver the message.  Signals suck for many many reasons and a file
descriptor based notification potentially can be much simpler.

One of those many reasons is that by not following the common pattern
for filling in kernel_siginfo you have left uninitialized padding in
your structure that will be copied to userspace thus creating a kernel
information leak.  Similarly your code doesn't fill in about half the
fields that are present in the siginfo union for the _rt case.


I think a file descriptor based design could additionally address the
back and forth your design needs with keys to figure out what event has
happened and what user mode helper to invoke.



Ideally I would also like to see a design less tied to keys.  So that we
could use this for the other user mode helper cases as well.   That said
solving request_key appears to be the truly important part, there aren't
many other user mode helpers.  Still it would be nice if in theory the
design could be used to dispatch the coredump helper as well.
