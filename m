I believe I was thinking this task won't be reaped because release_task
can never be called.  Which I admit depending on where we oops in
do_exit is not strictly true.

We can guarantee the leak with:
	
	tsk->exit_state = EXIT_DEAD;
        refcount_inc(&tsk->rcu_users);


It just feels wrong to me to have something dead and broken sticking around
the scheduler queue.  Especially as something could come along and wake
it up and then what do we do.

Hmm.  I think we want that tsk->exit_state = EXIT_DEAD regardless to
prevent it from being reaped and possibly causing more harm.
