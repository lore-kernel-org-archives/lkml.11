The "I am dying" state for a task is fatal_signal_pending, at least
before get_signal is reached, for a process there is SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT.
Something I am busily cleaning up and making more reliable at the
moment.

What is the event that is happening?  Is it
tracehook_report_syscall_exit or something else?

From the bits I have seen it seems like something else.

This is where I get confused what TIF_WORK bits matter?

I expect if anything else mattered we would need to change it to
HANDLER_EXIT.

I made a mistake conflating to cases and I want to make certain I
successfully separate those two cases at the end of the day.
