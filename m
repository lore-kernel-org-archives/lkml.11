Nice investigation.

So basically what you are saying is that commit b4bfa3fcfe3b was the
implementation of [1], but left out the removal of the tsk_is_pi_blocked(),
and that what you are seeing is the problem that is described in [1].

Can you add this in the change log:

"As described in [1]:

   The schedule process must distinguish between blocking on a regular
   sleeping lock (rwsem and mutex) and a RT-only sleeping lock (spinlock
   and rwlock):
   - rwsem and mutex must flush block requests (blk_schedule_flush_plug())
     even if blocked on a lock. This can not deadlock because this also
     happens for non-RT.
     There should be a warning if the scheduling point is within a RCU read
     section.

   - spinlock and rwlock must not flush block requests. This will deadlock
     if the callback attempts to acquire a lock which is already acquired.
     Similarly to being preempted, there should be no warning if the
     scheduling point is within a RCU read section.

and with the tsk_is_pi_blocked() in the scheduler path, we hit the first
issue."
