Subject: [PATCH v5 0/2] mac80211: Trigger disconnect for STA during target hardware restart
Date:   Tue,  8 Mar 2022 17:23:23 +0530

Currently in case of target hardware restart ,we just reconfig and
re-enable the security keys and enable the network queues to start
data traffic back from where it was interrupted.

Many ath10k wifi chipsets have sequence numbers for the data
packets assigned by firmware and the mac sequence number will
restart from zero after target hardware restart leading to mismatch
in the sequence number expected by the remote peer vs the sequence
number of the frame sent by the target firmware.

This mismatch in sequence number will cause out-of-order packets
on the remote peer and all the frames sent by the device are dropped
until we reach the sequence number which was sent before we restarted
the target hardware

In order to fix this, we trigger a disconnect in case of hardware
restart. After this there will be a fresh connection and thereby
avoiding the dropping of frames by remote peer.

The right fix would be to pull the entire data path into the host
which is not feasible or would need lots of complex/inefficient
datapath changes.

Changes from v3:
- Fixed commit text errors
- Remove excess space in "hardware  restart"
- Removed blank line between the function description and the arguments
