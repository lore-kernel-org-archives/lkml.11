Since the sk_state keeps SMC_INIT and does not correctly indicate the state of clcsock, it should end
up calling kernel_connect() again to get the actual connection state of clcsock.

And I'm sorry there is a problem that if sock->state==SS_CONNECTED and sk_state==SMC_INIT, further call
of smc_connect will return -EINVAL where -EISCONN is preferred. 
The steps to reproduce:
1）switch fallback before connect, such as setsockopt TCP_FASTOPEN
2）connect with noblocking and returns -EINPROGRESS. (sock->state changes to SS_CONNECTING)
3) end up calling connect with noblocking again and returns 0. (kernel_connect() returns 0 and sock->state changes to
   SS_CONNECTED but sk->sk_state stays SMC_INIT)
4) call connect again, maybe by mistake, will return -EINVAL, but -EISCONN is preferred.

What do you think about if we synchronize the sk_state to SMC_ACTIVE instead of keeping SMC_INIT when clcsock
connected successfully in fallback case described above.

...
if (smc->use_fallback) {
	sock->state = rc ? SS_CONNECTING : SS_CONNECTED;
	if (!rc)
		sk->sk_state = SMC_ACTIVE;    /* synchronize sk_state from SMC_INIT to SMC_ACTIVE */
	goto out;
}
...
