I think I'm coming around to this view that having a sysctl return
-ENODATA is weird. It makes `sysctl -a` always complain to stderr, for
example, which seems bad.

I'm still not convinced there's value in having a counter or a UUID, but
if you had to choose, would you prefer a counter or a UUID? It sounds
like the former, because you see a use for distinguishing between zero
and non-zero? Or did you finally agree with me that vmgenid isn't
granular enough for that?
