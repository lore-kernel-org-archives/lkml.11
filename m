I have not yet been able to figure out how to run gst-pluggin-scanner in
a way that triggers this yet.  In truth I can't figure out how to
run gst-pluggin-scanner in a useful way.

I am going to set up some unit tests and see if I can reproduce your
hang another way, but if you could give me some more information on what
you are doing to trigger this I would appreciate it.

Eric
