Another detail I have overlooked.  Thank you.

Or we can change task_stopped_code look something like:

static int *task_stopped_code(struct task_struct *p, bool ptrace)
{
	if (ptrace) {
-		if (task_is_traced(p) && !(p->jobctl & JOBCTL_LISTENING))
+		if (p->ptrace && !(p->jobctl & JOBCTL_LISTENING))
			return &p->exit_code;
	} else {
		if (p->signal->flags & SIGNAL_STOP_STOPPED)
			return &p->signal->group_exit_code;
	}
	return NULL;
}

I probably need to do a little bit more to ensure that it isn't an
actual process exit_code in p->exit_code.  But the we don't have to
limit ourselves to being precisely in the task_is_traced stopped place
for the fast path.

My goal and I still think it makes sense (if not my implementation)
is to move set_special_state as close as possible to schedule().

That way we can avoid sleeping spin_locks clobbering it and making
our life difficult.

My hope is we can just clean up ptrace_stop instead of making it more
complicated and harder to follow.  Not that I am fundamentally opposed
to the quiesce bit but the code is already very hard to follow because
of all it's nuance and complexity, and I would really like to reduce
that complexity if we can possibly figure out how.
