The original explanation for handling this is:

commit 66519f549ae516e7ff2f24a8a5134713411a4a58
Author: Roland McGrath <roland@redhat.com>
Date:   Tue Jan 4 05:38:15 2005 -0800

    [PATCH] fix ptracer death race yielding bogus BUG_ON
    
    There is a BUG_ON in ptrace_stop that hits if the thread is not ptraced.
    However, there is no synchronization between a thread deciding to do a
    ptrace stop and so going here, and its ptracer dying and so detaching from
    it and clearing its ->ptrace field.
    
    The RHEL3 2.4-based kernel has a backport of a slightly older version of
    the 2.6 signals code, which has a different but equivalent BUG_ON.  This
    actually bit users in practice (when the debugger dies), but was
    exceedingly difficult to reproduce in contrived circumstances.  We moved
    forward in RHEL3 just by removing the BUG_ON, and that fixed the real user
    problems even though I was never able to reproduce the scenario myself.
    So, to my knowledge this scenario has never actually been seen in practice
    under 2.6.  But it's plain to see from the code that it is indeed possible.
    
    This patch removes that BUG_ON, but also goes further and tries to handle
    this case more gracefully than simply avoiding the crash.  By removing the
    BUG_ON alone, it becomes possible for the real parent of a process to see
    spurious SIGCHLD notifications intended for the debugger that has just
    died, and have its child wind up stopped unexpectedly.  This patch avoids
    that possibility by detecting the case when we are about to do the ptrace
    stop but our ptracer has gone away, and simply eliding that ptrace stop
    altogether as if we hadn't been ptraced when we hit the interesting event
    (signal or ptrace_notify call for syscall tracing or something like that).

And it was all about
	BUG_ON(!(current->ptrace & PT_PTRACED));
At the beginning of ptrace_stop.

Which seems like a bit of buggy overkill.

Still chewing.
