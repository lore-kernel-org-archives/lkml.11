There is also a very strong security use case for not putting security
checks in the creation of the user namespace.

In particular there are all kinds of kernel features that are useful for
building sandboxes namespaces, chroot, etc, that previous to user
namespaces were not possible to make available to unprivileged users
because they could confuse suid-root executables.  With user namespaces
the concern about confusing suid-root executable goes away.

The only justification I have ever heard for restricting the user
namespace is because it indirectly allows for greater kernel attack
surface.

Do you have a case for restricting the user namespace other than the
kernel is buggy and the user namespace makes the kernel bugs easier
to access?

How does increasing the attack surface of the kernel make the situation
that the kernel is buggy and the attack surface is too big better?

Perhaps it is explained somewhere down-thread and I just have not caught
up yet, but so far I have not see a description of why it makes sense
for a security module to restrict the kernel here.

p.s.  I am little disappointed that I was not copied on this thread
given that it is my code you are messing with, and I was in an earlier
version of this thread.
