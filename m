Thank you.

Until I can figure out why this is causing problems I have dropped the
following two patches from my queue:
 signal: Make SIGKILL during coredumps an explicit special case
 signal: Drop signals received after a fatal signal has been processed

I have replaced them with the following two patches that just do what
is needed for the rest of the code in the series:
 signal: Have prepare_signal detect coredumps using
 signal: Make coredump handling explicit in complete_signal

Perversely my failure to change the SIGKILL handling when coredumps are
happening proves to me that I need to change the SIGKILL handling when
coredumps are happening to make the code more maintainable.
