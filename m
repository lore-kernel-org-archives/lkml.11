Maybe it should be set unconditionally now, until we figure out how to
make it more granular.

In terms of granularity, I saw other folks suggesting making it per-task
(so, presumably, a prctl() knob), and others mentioning doing it just
for kernel crypto. For the latter, I guess the crypto API could set it
inside of its abstractions, and the various lib/crypto APIs could set it
at invocation time. I wonder, though, what's the cost of
enabling/disabling it? Would we in fact need a kind of lazy-deferred
disabling, like we have with kernel_fpu_end()? I also wonder what
crypto-adjacent code might wind up being missed if we're going function
by function. Like, obviously we'd set this for crypto_memneq, but what
about potential unprotected `==` of ID numbers that could leak some info
in various protocols? What other subtle nearby code should we be
thinking about, that relies on constant time logic but isn't neatly
folded inside a crypto_do_something() function?

Jason
