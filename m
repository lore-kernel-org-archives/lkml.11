Hmm, is there anyone other than iommu-dma who actually depends on the 
resource list being sorted in ascending order of bus address? I recall 
at the time I pushed for creating the list in sorted order as it was the 
simplest and most efficient option, but there's no technical reason we 
couldn't create it in as-found order and defer the sorting until 
iova_reserve_pci_windows() (at worst that could even operate on a 
temporary copy if need be). It's just more code, which didn't need to 
exist without a good reason, but if this is one then exist it certainly may.

Cheers,
Robin.
