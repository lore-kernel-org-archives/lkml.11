I provisionally applied this to pci/vga and put it into -next just
to get a little runtime on it.

But I'd prefer not to unilaterally yank this out of drivers/gpu
without a consensus from the GPU folks that this is the right thing to
do.

Any thoughts?  If it seems OK to you, I think patch 1/11 (the move
itself) is all you would need to look at, although of course I would
still be grateful for any review and feedback on the rest.

After it's in drivers/pci, all the blame for any issues would come my
way.
