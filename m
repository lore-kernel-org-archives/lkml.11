 From the context, I'm not sure it is redundant - as far as I can tell 
this comment seems to be describing a sequence of 3 commands, where 
"current" is the first, "next" is the second, and "next next" implies 
the third. The whole comment could certainly be reworded more clearly, 
but as it stands I suspect a replacement like s/next next/next+1/ is 
more likely to be correct.
