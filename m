Thank you for catching that.  I was leaning too much on the description
in the comment of why force_uaccess_begin is there.

Catching up on the state of set_fs/get_fs removal it appears like a lot
of progress has been made and on a lot of architectures set_fs/get_fs is
just gone, and force_uaccess_begin is a noop.

On architectures that still have set_fs/get_fs it appears all of the old
warts are present and kernel threads still run with set_fs(KERNEL_DS).

Assuming it won't be too much longer before the rest of the arches have
set_fs/get_fs removed it looks like it makes sense to leave the
force_uaccess_begin where it is, and just let force_uaccess_begin be
removed when set_fs/get_fs are removed from the tree.

Christoph does it look like the set_fs/get_fs removal work is going
to stall indefinitely on some architectures?  If so I think we want to
find a way to get kernel threads to run with set_fs(USER_DS) on the
stalled architectures.  Otherwise I think we have a real hazard of
introducing bugs that will only show up on the stalled architectures.

I finally understand now why when I updated set_child_tid in the kthread
code early in fork why x86 was fine another architecture was not.
