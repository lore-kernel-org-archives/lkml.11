A silly question.  Have you looked to see if you can perform this work
with io_uring?

I know io_uring does all of the batching already, so I think io_uring is
as ready as anything is to solve the performance issues, and the general
small file problem.  There is also the bpf information extractor (Sorry
I forget what it's proper name is) that also can solve many of the small
read problems.

I am very confused you mention atomicity but I don't see any new
filesystem hooks or anyway you could implement atomicity for reads
much less writes in the patch you posted.

If the real target is something like fsinfo that is returning
information that is not currently available except by possibly
processing /proc/self/mountinfo perhaps a more targeted name would
help.

I certainly did not get the impression when skimming your introduction
to this that you were trying to solve anything except reading a number
of small files.
